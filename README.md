# Overview
 A Rust application that monitors network traffic (e.g., by capturing packets using pcap or similar, or by listening on a specific port for application-level data). It then feeds relevant log data or summarized network events to a local Ollama instance to identify potential anomalies, generate summaries of traffic patterns, or even suggest troubleshooting steps.

# Usage

This is a command-line application. You interact with it by running the compiled binary from your terminal and passing various arguments to control its behavior.

**1. Basic Usage (Required):**

This command starts the monitor on a specific network interface (e.g., `en0` on macOS, `eth0` on Linux).

```bash
cargo run -- --interface <your-network-interface>
```

**2. Custom Ollama Configuration:**

You can specify a different URL for the Ollama API and choose a different model.

```bash
cargo run -- --interface <your-network-interface> --ollama-url http://192.168.1.5:11434 --model mistral
```

**3. Adjusting the Event Buffer:**

This controls how many network events are collected before they are sent to Ollama for analysis.

```bash
cargo run -- --interface <your-network-interface> --buffer-size 50
```

# Networking Aspect

Packet Capture: Using a crate like pcap (requires libpcap or WinPcap/Npcap).

# Socket Listening 
Listening on specific ports for application-level data (e.g., a simple HTTP server that receives log data from other services).

# Data Serialization/Deserialization
Processing network data, which might be in various formats.

Ollama Integration: The Ollama model would be prompted with network data to perform tasks like:

"Summarize network activity for the last 5 minutes."

"Are there any unusual patterns in these network logs?"

"What might be causing the high latency observed in this traffic?"
